I'm an Oberlin Grad with High Honors in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I have 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer at Google, and have published research in the field of general AI and Game Theory. I consider myself a scientist and artist, and have made plenty of digital art that will be up on my website [madebymath.art](https://www.madebymath.art). 

I also have a background in nonprofit work, and significant knowledge of the medical field as a former pre-med student and Brandeis Global Youth Summit attendee. I have also interned at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington D.C. as a lab assistant in the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Lab, and at Optoro in D.C. as a Software Engineer working on their reverse logistics systems.

My research
======
My main research interest is in interpretable AI. As someone that likes provable answers to problems, black-boxes drive me crazy. I have published a thesis trying to tackle a subset of General AI that uses a "white-box" approach. That paper is called **[General Game Playing as a Bandit-Arms Problem: A Multiagent Monte-Carlo Solution Exploiting Nash Equilibria](https://digitalcommons.oberlin.edu/honors/116/)**. It combines methods from Game Theory and Machine Learning to solve non-deterministic games (*like chess*) using a simulated multi-agent system that I have [implemented on GitHub](https://github.com/MatheweB/GameAgentsHonors/tree/master).

I am also passionate about Math Art, and have drawn a lot of my inspiration from [Bob Bosch](https://dominoartwork.com). Many of my artworks have research papers behind them describing the methodology and approach to creating the final images. That art will be posted on [madebymath.art](https://www.madebymath.art).

My career
======
### Optoro:
As an intern at Optoro, and worked on the full stack from front-end landing pages for major retail websites, to iOS applications, to automated cross-service integration testing.

### Google:
I started as an **Engineering Resident** at Google in 2019 (the [residency](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112003500/https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/engres.html) was sadly 86-ed).

On the **[Android Build](https://developer.android.com/build/gradle-build-overview) Team**, I helped optimize Android smart-sync for every Android dev. I also worked on an ML build-optimization project.

On the **[Android Mainline](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/modular-system) Team**, I led the Android API-Coverage initiative that touched 800M+ Android devices.

Finally, on the Developer-GenAI team for Android & Chrome Infrastructure, I led research initiatives and implemented an IDE tool for open-source developers to automatically generate unit-tests. I also created data pipelines and datasets to train Google's internal code-LLMs.
